### **Summary**

The game follows the story of a hunter-gatherer named Kael, who lives in a small tribe in the pre-civilization world. In this world, tribes are identified with an animal and kael´s tribe is recognized as the wolf tribe. Kael's tribe is in dispute with other tribes over the grasslands in prehistoric Europe. His life takes a dramatic turn when his young son is kidnapped by the leader of the Bear tribe in revenge for the disagreement of a treaty among tribes.

Determined to rescue his son, Kael sets out on a perilous journey through the forbidden forest, the Sarcos Lake and the settlement of the Bear tribe, where he must fight against the Bear tribesmen along with his tribe´s emblematic animal, the wolf, who will help him determine the path to follow in order to find his son. As Kael goes through this journey, he must ensure the protection of the wolf. To fight off enemies and protect the wolf, Kael gathers resources from the environment to craft his own weapons.

Kael finally reaches the settlement of the Bear tribe, where he engages in a fierce battle with the most menacing tribesmen and the leader of the tribe. Using all of his skills and weapons to overcome the powerful tribe, Kael will try to rescue his son.

_Wild Frontier: The Rescue_ will be a 2D action Role Playing Game with real-time combat system. It will be based on pixel art videogames with a top down view. Players can expect a thrilling and immersive RPG experience with a focus on action. As the designers of this game, we want the innovation of this product to lie in providing the player with a feeling of responsibility towards the companion of the player (the wolf) throughout the game. This is embedded as much as possible into the game to the degree where the player needs to apply the best strategy to ensure the protection of the wolf in order to move on to the next levels.

### **Gameplay**

The game is set in a pre-civilization world and the player takes on the role of the main character Kael as he goes through different levels where he has to scavenge for resources such as materials for crafting weapons to kill the enemies and protect his tribe´s animal, the wolf, to track his son down.

The player starts the game in the forbidden forest where he can explore the world and learn to craft his first weapons by interacting with the environment. The main character has two initial tools, the hand axe, which can be used to chop down trees and a pick axe, to mine the stone rocks to craft different weapons. The weapons that can be crafted are bows and arrows, swords, slingshots, spears, boomerangs and stone knives and each of them require different resources/materials that the player needs to collect from the environment.

The weapons have different stats that describe a characteristic about the weapon, such as the amount of damage the weapon inflicts when it hits an enemy (damage), the speed with which the weapon can execute an attack (weapon speed) and the weapon efficiency during combat (weapon efficiency).

The goal of the game is to rescue the son from the leader of the Bear Tribe. In order to do this, the player must decide to craft the best weapons to fight off enemies and protect the wolf throughout the level. The wolf will travel from point A to point B, going through different checkpoints. During each level the player must make its way through the world fighting off enemies and ensuring the protection of its companion.

The player is able to walk, run, and attack in different ways depending on the weapon being used. In the beginning of the game, the player starts off with a fairly weak and poorly equipped character. As the player goes through the levels, he can increase the stats of the weapons that he crafts using the wood and rock that is recollected or to restore his health bar by creating health potions with healing remedies that he can collect when enemies are killed.

The player and the wolf will start with a full health bar and whenever the player or the wolf take damage from an enemy attack, an amount of the health will be deducted depending on the strength of the enemy attack. The player has the choice to build health potions with the healing remedies that he can then use to restore his health or the wolf's health.

Throughout the game, the player can customize the main character by deciding the weapons which will be used at a certain moment to attack enemies. The player is able to craft the weapons mentioned above but it is only allowed to carry 3 weapons at once. Therefore, the player can select only 3 weapons from the inventory, and can change his current weapons every 3 minutes.

As the player progresses through the game, he will encounter more challenging enemies, requiring him to use different strategies and weapons to defeat them. Enemies are of three types: Grims are short range attacking enemies that use a stone knife to attack the player. Impalers are also short range attacking enemies that use a spear to attack the player. Finally, Marauders are long range attacking enemies that throw arrows at the player.

### **Mindset**

As the game designers of this game we would want to provoke a sense of adventure and excitement in the player. The game is set in a pre-civilization world with different types of enemies that require different strategies and weapons to defeat. This encourages the player to explore the environment, scavenge for resources, and craft weapons to progress through the game.

At the same time, the limited carry capacity of weapons and cooldown effect on weapon selection (inventory) is made to provoke a sense of urgency and tension in the player, requiring them to carefully plan their weapon choices and use them strategically against different enemies.

Alos, the ability to choose between healing the wolf or healing the player can also make them feel empowered and in control, especially as they progress through the game.
Overall, we would want to create a balance between adventure and tension in the player, while also allowing the player to feel a sense of progression as they go through the levels and advance towards the goal of rescuing the son.

## _Graphics_

### **Style Attributes**

The color palette that will be used for the game in general will have colors found in nature such as green, brown or blue, as our locations include forests and lakes that at the same time will have elements the player can interact with such as rocks or trees as mentioned before.

The graphic style of our game will be a Pixel-y type (pixel art) with thick outlines and bright hues, together with, as the name suggests, pixel-like forms.

As we've mentioned before, one of the main characteristics/features of our game is the possibility that the player has to interact with the environment so weapons can be created and improved, and in order to make the player notice that an object can be destroyed to obtain raw material, the object will shine a little for a moment after a relatively long period of time, this to let the player infer where the interacteble objects are within the map and which object could be one of them.

## _Sounds/Music_

---

### **Style Attributes**

For this 2D pixel art game, we are considering the use of instrumental music that is associated with traditional tribal music. Percussion instruments such as drums, rattles, and shakers can give a sense of rhythm and movement, while wind instruments such as flutes and horns can add melody and emotion.

1. Tempo

   The tempo and key of the music should match the mood and atmosphere of the game. For this game, we will start with a slower tempo to build tension and then increase the speed as the player reaches fighting zone checkpoint.

2. Influences and Genre:

   The game's setting and storyline allowed us to explore traditional tribal music. Incorporating elements of ambient music, such as nature sounds and atmospheric effects will also add to the game's immersive experience.

3. Sound Effects:

   For sound effects, we consider using a mix of realistic and exaggerated sounds. For example, the sound of the hunter-gatherer walking through the forest could be realistic, but the sound of the rival tribe's leader's footsteps could be exaggerated to add tension and anticipation. Volume, panning, and pitch can also be used to create a sense of space and depth in the game's audio.

## _Data Collection_

For this reason, the information that will be saved to the database for statistics of the game is as follows:

1. Most built weapons by players.
